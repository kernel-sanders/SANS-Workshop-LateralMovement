<div>

This hands-on, scenario-driven workshop delves into how attackers move stealthily through Active Directory environments using user impersonation and lateral movement techniques. Participants will explore how attackers exploit credentials and trust relationships to expand their access, and how defenders can detect, prevent, and respond to such threats.

Through simulated exercises and guided labs, participants will walk through real-world attack paths such as (over)Pass-the-Hash, Kerberoasting, and token impersonation.

Learning Objectives:

- Understand the key mechanisms behind user impersonation in Active Directory.
- Demonstrate how attackers perform lateral movement via tools and techniques such as:
- Pass-the-Hash
- Pass-the-Ticket/Overpass-the-Hash
- Remote Services Abuse (SMB, WMI, RDP, WinRM)\
- SOCKS PTH
- Kerberoasting
- Token Impersonation
- Token Creation
- This hands-on workshop is ideal for Penetration Testers with limited knowledge about AD internals.
